A holistic view of handling test-time and training-time threats. Certified defenses against test-time and training-time attacks in a holistic view I have proposed two certified defenses, BagFlip and PECAN, against data poisoning attacks that can modify both the training set and test inputs. These defenses construct a verifiable training algorithm over the original algorithm by creating an ensemble of models, each trained on subsets of the training data. These defenses adopt a holistic view of inference and training processes by regarding these processes as a closed box, abstracting away the intricate details of the training algorithm, which can pose challenges for verification techniques in establishing meaningful bounds. Leveraging this holistic view, BagFlip employs randomized smoothing to construct probabilistic proofs. In contrast, PECAN generates deterministic proofs by seamlessly integrating training-time and test-time proofs derived from corresponding techniques.\n","date":1693699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693699200,"objectID":"d3f983500316ca577193414a55aa74c7","permalink":"https://foreverzyh.github.io/project/project_1/","publishdate":"2023-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project_1/","section":"project","summary":"This project designs certifiable defenses against data poisoning and backdoor attacks during training.

A unique characteristic of deep learning models is their vulnerability to malicious attacks, even when the underlying code implementations are correct. Among the various types of attacks, inference-time (or test-time) attacks have been extensively studied as they directly affect the performance and reliability of the model. These attacks craft a human-imperceptible perturbation to the test input to deceive the model into making incorrect predictions.\nTest-time defenses and attacks on deep learning models have been a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. My research aims to end this game by providing deep learning model inference with well-defined and provable guarantees. I focus on the robustness verification of language models, an area previously unexplored due to the challenge of the discreteness of the inputs.\nPapers: A3T (ICML2020), ARC (EMNLP2021)\nKey ideas:\nLanguages for describing test-time robustness for deep learning models. Training approaches for improving model robustness. An abstract interpretation technique for verifying model robustness. Programmable perturbation space Existing work on robustness for deep learning model inference employs ad-hoc perturbations tailored to specific attacks, such as synonym substitutions. However, these perturbations do not apply to a wide range of scenarios. To address this limitation, I introduced the concept of a programmable perturbation space and designed a language for defining attacks/perturbations to input sequences for language models. The versatile language allows users to express their specific robustness requirements as user-defined string transformations and combinations. For example, it can express a perturbation that removes stop words and duplicates exclamation and question marks in a movie review. Furthermore, this language enables robustness verification and training approaches to compile and understand users’ needs seamlessly.\nVerifying robustness of recursive models Given a robustness specification as a programmable perturbation space, my approach, ARC, generates proofs of robustness for recursive models, such as LSTMs or Tree-LSTMs. The key idea underlying ARC involves symbolically recursive memoization and abstraction of sets of possible hidden states, a task that becomes infeasible for enumeration due to its exponential growth with the input length. As ARC over-approximates the sets of all possible outcomes, it captures the worst-case scenario, thus establishing proofs for model robustness.\nRobust training approaches When given a programmable perturbation space, the challenge of training robust models against the space lies in accurately approximating the worst-case loss. Traditional approximation methods provide loose approximations, such as the under-approximation by adversarial training or the over-approximation by provable training. To overcome this challenge, I proposed A3T, an innovative approach that approximates the worst-case by decomposing the programmable perturbation space into two subsets: one that can be explored using adversarial training and another that can be abstracted using provable training. This novel idea of decomposition has been adopted by the state-of-the-art robust training method, SABR.\n","date":1693612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693612800,"objectID":"13c691720a8605e74d914f8fec455dec","permalink":"https://foreverzyh.github.io/project/project_2/","publishdate":"2023-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project_2/","section":"project","summary":"This project proves and improves the robustness of deep learning models against inference-time adversarial examples.

Deep learning models have made remarkable advancements in solving complex and diverse problems. The training and inference of these models are coded built on platforms like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This coding requires a programming paradigm that differs significantly from traditional ones. For instance, programming logic relies more heavily on intensive matrix operations and activation functions than traditional programming structures such as branches and loops. As a result, new defects have emerged in deep learning code, and we need to rethink the problem of verifying code correctness and providing provably correct fixes to these defects.\nIn my research on providing provable guarantees for the correctness of deep learning code, I pose the following questions: What are these new defects? Which defect type is of most concern to the deep learning community? The first question led me to conduct a pioneering empirical study of novel defects in deep learning code. This study found that numerical defects, which often manifest as NaN or INF during neural network computations, are prevalent in deep learning code and can significantly impair the model accuracy, potentially leading to system crashes. This finding addressed the second question and guided my work on ensuring deep learning code is free of numerical defects.\nDEBAR: A static analyzer over the computational graph. RANUM: A framework for reliability assurance. Papers: An empirical study (ISSTA2018), DEBAR (FSE2020), RANUM (ICSE2023)\nKey ideas:\nA pioneering empirical study of defects in deep learning code. An abstract interpretation technique for verifying the absence of numerical defects. A framework for reliability assurance against numerical defects by providing failure-exhibiting tests and provably correct fix suggestions. A pioneering empirical study Motivated by the need to investigate emerging defects in deep learning code, I conducted a pioneering empirical study on the root causes, symptoms, and fixing strategies of these new defects. This empirical study not only serves as a bedrock of my work but also inspires numerous initiatives in the research community. For example, our study identified new defects such as unaligned-shape defects, where the shape of a tensor, a data structure predominantly used in deep learning, does not align with its expected shape. Subsequently, a corresponding approach has been proposed to detect this new defect. Additionally, Islam et al. conducted a further empirical study and “adapted the classification scheme of root causes and bug effects” from our study.\nVerification of the absence of numerical defects My work, DEBAR, detects numerical defects in deep learning code. It can either construct a proof confirming the absence of numerical defects within the code or identify suspicious computational graph nodes that may have numerical defects. To construct such proof, I design refined yet scalable abstract domains, tensor partitioning and interval with affine equality relation, to over-approximate the output range of each node in the computational graph. If a node receives an invalid range or its output overflows, DEBAR will report this node as suspicious. And if no such node exists in the code, DEBAR then gets a correctness proof owing to the soundness of abstract interpretation. DEBAR is highly scalable as it only takes an average of 12.1 seconds for each model, while maintaining a low false positive rate of 7.7%. DEBAR has received recognition with the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at FSE 2020 and it detected 11 real-world bugs of 48 models implemented in an official repository maintained by the TensorFlow team (See, e.g., defect 1, defect 2).\nProvably correct fixes to numerical defects Once the defects are identified, developers need to fix them. We found that developers either provided no fixes or designed heuristic fixes that did not eliminate these defects, such as reducing the learning rate. Such heuristic fixes often delay the triggering of numerical defects during training and further obscure the defects. Our work, RANUM, automatically synthesizes provably correct fixes to these defects for developers. The fixes take the form of clipping the input ranges of some computational graph nodes. Striking the right balance with these input ranges is critical; overly tight ranges can hinder the model accuracy, whereas overly wide ranges may still result in numerical defects. We propose an abstraction optimization algorithm to find the tightest input ranges that provably eliminate the defects.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"482b03b1cd1950497ab767037c9acf41","permalink":"https://foreverzyh.github.io/project/project_3/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project_3/","section":"project","summary":"This project ensures the correctness of deep learning training and inference codes built on top of TensorFlow/PyTorch.
